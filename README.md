# WiSpy Scan Processor

This application is an attempt to make processing scan data from wardriving a bit easier. It integrates with [Joseph Hewitt's firmware](https://github.com/JosephHewitt/wardriver_rev3) for the [WiSpy hackerbox](https://hackerboxes.com/products/hackerbox-0089-wispy). Once you have your device configured to connect to your network on boot, this application can be run on a device on the same network and automatically process scan data once it detects the WiSpy connected. It can both upload files directly to your [Wiggle Account](https://wigle.net/), and/or copy them to a local directory of your chosing.

## Quick Start

 - Install node 19 (Using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) is recommented)
 - Clone this repo - `git clone git@github.com:ZackMattor/wispy-scan-processor.git`
 - Install packages `npm install`
 - Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and populate values (See the Environment Variables section below)
 - Start the process `npm start`

## Lifecycle

 - Tries to load the homepage of the WiSpy web interface. If it can't load it it just waits for 30 seconds and loops.
 - If it can load the homepage it gets a list of files to process and goes through the following for each files.
   - Uploads to wiggle if the WIGGLE_API_KEY is set
   - Copies to your archive location if the ARCHIVE_LOCATION is set
   - Deletes the file off of the WiSpy
 - Once it gets through all of the files it waits for 90s which will allow the WiSpy to boot up all the way.
